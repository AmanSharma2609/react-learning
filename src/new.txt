React cache, Scheduler

Profiling tool
use react memo to reduce the render time when using with functional component the hooks part it reduced render time from 17.8ms to 8ms
the github user filter option when by default we are rendering the 5 user then when we click on 10 user the we don't re render the 1st 5 users because of memo

const filteredUser = useMemo (
    () => filterUsers(users,searchText),
    [users, searchText]
)
react will call it whenever these two dependecies changes just like the useEffect callback
