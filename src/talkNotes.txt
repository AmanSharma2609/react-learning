Static Routing
If you’ve used Rails, Express, Ember, Angular etc. you’ve used static routing. 
In these frameworks, you declare your routes as part of your app’s initialization before any rendering takes place.
 React Router pre-v4 was also static (mostly). Let’s take a look at how to configure routes in express:

 Note how the routes are declared before the app listens.
  The client side routers we’ve used are similar.
   In Angular you declare your routes up front and then import them to the top-level AppModule before rendering:
